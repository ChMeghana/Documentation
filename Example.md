# Healthcare Application Architecture Flow

## Example Scenario: A Patient Requests Medical Records

### **üìå Step-by-Step Flow**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **User Requests Medical Records** *(Presentation Layer)*
   - Patient logs in and taps "View Medical History."
   - The UI triggers the request and displays a loading indicator.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Business Logic Checks Authorization** *(Domain Layer)*
   - The system verifies:
     - Is the user authenticated?
     - Do they have permission to access records?
   - If valid, it requests data from the repository.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Fetch Data from API/Local Storage** *(Data Layer)*
   - If records exist in local storage, they are retrieved immediately.
   - Otherwise, a network request is sent to the backend.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Handle Networking & Storage** *(Core Layer)*
   - The **network module** manages API communication.
   - The **local storage module** ensures offline access.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Backend Processes Request** *(Node.js, SQL Server, MongoDB)*
   - The backend retrieves medical records from the database.
   - If valid, the data is sent back to the frontend.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Display Medical Records to User** *(Presentation Layer)*
   - The UI updates and shows the medical records.
   - The user receives a confirmation notification.
